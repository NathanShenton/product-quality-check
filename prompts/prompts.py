            "only the claims provided, but always prioritise natural, fluent, and meaningful text over minimal deletion.\n\n"
    
            "GENERAL ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS (read carefully):\n"
            "• Treat {{product_data}} as a dictionary with the following keys:\n"
            "  - 'SKU'\n"
            "  - 'Exported Data From Web' (HTML string)\n"
            "  - 'claim_to_remove' (string of one or more claims delimited by '||')\n"
            "  - 'claim_id' (string of one or more IDs delimited by '||' aligned to 'claim_to_remove' via position)\n"
            "• Base your work ONLY on these inputs. Do not infer or add new marketing content.\n"
            "• Preserve the original HTML structure and tag order wherever possible.\n"
            "• Perform case-insensitive matching. Normalise whitespace; treat curly/straight quotes as equivalent.\n"
            "• Allow minor morphological variants (plural/singular) and common hyphenation variants (e.g., 'eco friendly' vs 'eco-friendly').\n"
            "• If a claim appears in multiple places, remove all occurrences.\n\n"
    
            "REMOVAL RULES (apply in this order):\n"
            "1) LIST ITEMS: If a <li> mainly expresses the claim (or is essentially the claim), remove the entire <li>…</li>.\n"
            "2) INLINE PHRASES: If a claim appears inside prose (<p>, <em>, <strong>, etc.), attempt to remove only the minimal phrase.\n"
            "   This is only valid if the remaining sentence still reads naturally, is grammatical, and conveys a coherent idea.\n"
            "3) SENTENCES: If phrase removal leaves the sentence ungrammatical, awkward, incomplete, or semantically hollow (e.g. nonsense fragment),\n"
            "   escalate to removing the entire sentence instead. Repair punctuation/spacing in neighbours.\n"
            "4) CONTAINERS: If a container becomes empty or meaningless (e.g., empty <ul>, or a <p> left with just punctuation),\n"
            "   remove the container element entirely.\n"
            "5) DO NOT introduce new claims, rephrase benefits, or add promotional language. Keep edits conservative.\n\n"
    
            "READABILITY & STRUCTURE TWEAKS (logical clean-up only):\n"
            "• Fix doubled spaces and stray punctuation (e.g., ', ,', '. ,').\n"
            "• Remove dangling conjunctions left at sentence starts ('and', 'or', 'but') caused by a deletion.\n"
            "• Maintain list grammar consistency (no empty bullets, no trailing delimiters).\n"
            "• Always prefer full-sentence removal over leaving behind fragments that confuse meaning.\n"
            "• Keep original tags and ordering wherever possible; never re-wrap large sections in different tags.\n\n"
    
            "MATCHING & NORMALISATION DETAILS:\n"
            "• Split 'claim_to_remove' by '||' to get individual claim strings.\n"
            "• Split 'claim_id' by '||' to align IDs to claims by index when reporting which claims were removed.\n"
            "• Matching is case-insensitive and whitespace-insensitive (collapse runs of spaces for comparison).\n"
            "• Treat common hyphenation and apostrophe variants as equivalent (eco friendly ~ eco-friendly; nature’s ~ nature's).\n"
            "• When a claim is a substring of a longer phrase, remove the minimal surrounding phrase that conveys the claim,\n"
            "  unless this leaves a broken or meaningless sentence, in which case remove the whole sentence.\n\n"

            "• error: Serious issue prevented processing (e.g., empty/malformed HTML, input error).\n\n"
    
            "DECISION RULES (apply carefully):\n"
            "1. Identify all claims from 'claim_to_remove' and find occurrences in 'Exported Data From Web'.\n"
            "2. Prefer removing entire <li> nodes when they primarily express a listed claim.\n"
            "3. Remove phrases minimally where possible, but escalate to full sentence removal if the remainder is broken or meaningless.\n"
            "4. After deletions, always repair grammar and readability — prioritise fluent, natural text over minimal deletion.\n"
            "5. Track which claim IDs (by index in 'claim_id') were actually removed at least once.\n"
            "6. If a claim is not found, set status = 'unable_to_remove_not_found'.\n"
            "7. If found but cannot be removed without breaking readability or meaning, set status = 'unable_to_remove_breaks_readability'.\n"
            "8. If multiple statuses might apply, prioritise: error > breaks_readability > not_found > ok.\n\n"
    
            "DEBUG & EDGE CASES:\n"
            "• Claims repeated in multiple places must be removed everywhere.\n"
            "• If a claim overlaps with factual ingredient lists, remove only the promotional phrase; keep neutral facts.\n"
            "• If removing would break grammar or leave nonsense, classify as 'unable_to_remove_breaks_readability'.\n"
            "• Never add new benefits or paraphrase into a new claim.\n\n"
    
            "TOKEN & EVIDENCE CONTROL (strict):\n"
            "• Output must be compact, single-line JSON with minimal whitespace (no pretty-print).\n"
            "• Do not include any commentary or extraneous keys. Do not wrap HTML in additional markup.\n"
            "• 'cleaned_html' must be valid HTML (or well-formed fragment) and as close to the original as possible.\n"

              • Flags:\\n
                – *consumable?*  → true if it contains any of: vitamin, supplement, tablet, gummy, effervescent, tea, honey, powder, drink, food.\\n
                – *supplement?* → true if it also contains stricter cues: vitamin, supplement, tablet, gummy, effervescent.\\n\\n
            **STEP 2 – If supplement?**\\n
              • Locate a nutrition panel (JSON array, table, or heading “nutrition”, “nutrition facts”, “typical values”).\\n
              • If none found ⇒ add error {Missing Data} and set `nutrition_flag = Fail`.\\n
              • Else set `nutrition_flag = Pass`.\\n
              • Scan the panel text for ANY occurrence of “NRV” or “RI” (case-insensitive, with or without “%”).\\n
                – **If ZERO matches are found, you MUST set `nrv_flag = Fail` and add error {Missing NRV}.**\\n
                – Else set `nrv_flag = Pass`.\\n\\n
            **STEP 3 – If consumable but NOT supplement**\\n
              • Locate a nutrition panel as above.\\n
              • If none found ⇒ error {Missing Data} and `nutrition_flag = Fail`; otherwise `nutrition_flag = Pass`.\\n
              • Always set `nrv_flag = Pass` (NRV not required for non-supplement foods/drinks).\\n\\n
            **If not consumable at all**\\n
              • Set `nutrition_flag = Pass`, `nrv_flag = Pass`, and summary “Not a consumable product”.\\n\\n

            OUTPUT RULES:\\n
            • `summary` must be concise (e.g. “Supplement missing NRV” or “All checks passed”).\\n

            "   - The allergen word (or its synonym) appears fully outside any <b>, <B>, <strong>, or <STRONG> tag.\n"
            "   - The allergen is not part of a 'may contain', 'traces of', or similar precautionary statement.\n\n"
            "3) Evaluate each allergen synonym **independently**:\n"
            "   - Do not treat phrases like 'almond and hazelnut' as a single match.\n"
            "   - Check the bold status of each allergen word on its own.\n"
            "   - Use the following mappings:\n"
            "     • cereals containing gluten = wheat, rye, barley, oat, oats\n"
            "     • milk = milk powder, skimmed milk, whey (milk), casein, etc.\n"
            "     • soy = soy, soya, soja\n"
            "     • nuts = almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, pecans, Brazil nuts, pistachios, macadamias\n"
            "     • sulphites = sulphites, SO2, sulfur dioxide\n\n"
            "4) Tag logic rules:\n"
            "   - A match is **not** a violation if the allergen word is fully wrapped in bold tags.\n"
            "   - Do NOT flag allergen matches that are surrounded by <b> or <strong> tags, even if connectors like 'and' or commas between them are unbolded.\n"
            "   - If **any part of the allergen word** lies outside bold tags (e.g., <strong>alm</strong>ond), treat it as unbolded.\n\n"
            "5) You must perform a strict two-step verification process for every potential allergen match:\n"
            "   Step 1 — Candidate Detection:\n"
            "     - Identify any word from the allergen list that may be outside of bold tags.\n"
            "   Step 2 — Self-Audit:\n"
            "     - Re-check the actual HTML to confirm the allergen is fully outside bold tags and not part of a 'may contain' disclaimer.\n"
            "     - If the allergen is even partially within bold tags, or bolded elsewhere in the sentence, exclude it.\n"
            "     - Do not flag matches based on phrases — only bold tag positions.\n\n"
            "6) Return a strict JSON response in exactly the following structure:\n\n"
            "{\n"
            "  \"unbolded_allergens\": \"milk, fish, celery\",\n"
            "  \"debug_matches\": [\n"
            "    \"Confirmed unbolded 'milk': found 'milk powder' outside tags in: '<p>milk powder, sugar, cocoa</p>'\",\n"
            "    \"Confirmed unbolded 'wheat': found 'wheat flour' outside tags in: 'wheat flour, water, salt'\"\n"
            "  ]\n"
            "}\n\n"
            "If no unbolded allergens are found:\n\n"
            "{\n"
            "  \"unbolded_allergens\": \"\",\n"
            "  \"debug_matches\": []\n"
            "}\n\n"
            "7) debug_matches requirements:\n"
            "   - Include one entry per allergen flagged.\n"
            "   - Quote the exact synonym matched (e.g. 'hazelnuts', 'milk powder').\n"
            "   - Show the relevant HTML snippet where it appeared.\n"
            "   - Confirm the result of the self-audit. Examples:\n"
            "     • \"Confirmed unbolded 'wheat': found outside tags in: 'wheat flour, salt'\"\n"
            "     • \"Excluded 'almond': fully bolded in: '<strong>Almond</strong> and <strong>Hazelnut</strong>'\"\n"
            "     • \"Excluded 'hazelnuts': wrapped in <strong> tag inside: '[sugar, <strong>hazelnuts</strong>]'\n\n"
            "8) Final validation check (mandatory before returning results):\n"
            "   - Every allergen in \"unbolded_allergens\" MUST match one of the 14 allergen categories or their approved synonyms (as defined in Rule 3).\n"
            "   - If a term does not map to a known allergen group, it must NOT appear in the result.\n"
            "   - Each allergen listed must also have a corresponding entry in \"debug_matches\".\n"
            "   - If any allergen is missing a debug trace, exclude it from the output.\n"
